# Budget Adventure

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

There is no need to run the client and server separately for lauching the app.
The app can be run by using the `node` command to run the `app.js` file under the main repo (this runs both the client and server)

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
